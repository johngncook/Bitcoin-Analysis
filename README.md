# Bitcoin-Analysis
In this analysis we look at the relationship of bitcoin prices with tweets and see if we can use bitcoin tweets as a predictor for the price of the cryptocurrency.

In order to do this analysis the following libraries were used:

* numpy
* pandas
* seaborn 
* matplotlib
* quandl

Enter the following into the terminal:
```
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install seaborn
pip install matplotlib

```

### The Data
